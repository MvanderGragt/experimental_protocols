RNA isolation with TRI reagent [in the fume hood]

Needed materials and reagents: (all RNase-free)
•	TRI reagent (homemade Trizol)
•	Chloroform (fresh)
•	Isopropanol (= 2-propanol)
•	70% EtOH
•	mQ
•	mortar with pestle
•	vortex
•	1.5 ml and 2 ml (Safe-Lock) Eppendorf tubes (abbr. epps) (with chemicals Safe-Lock epps are needed when vortexing/centrifuging is done outside the fume hood)
•	autoclaved yellow and blue tips
•	centrifuge with cooling down option 4°C


1.	Grind frozen tissue (use 1.5 ml epps for trichomes).
2.	Weigh input material (max. 100 mg).
3.	Add 750 µl of TRI reagent (for max. 100mg of tissue). Vortex thoroughly.
4.	Add 250µl of mQ. Vortex shortly.
5.	Incubate for 5’ at RT with occasional mixing.
  a.	Optional: Centrifuge at 5,000 rcf for ~1’ to get rid of debris
  b.	Optional: Transfer supernatant to a fresh 2 ml epp (Safe-Lock).
6.	Add 200 µl of chloroform. 
7.	Shake for 15’’.
8.	Incubate for 2-3’ at RT with occasional mixing.
9.	Centrifuge at 11,000 rcf for 15’.
10.	Transfer the upper (aqueous) phase (~420 µl) to a fresh 2 ml epp (no Safe-Lock). 
11.	Add 1:1 volume of chloroform.
12.	Shake for 15’’.
13.	Centrifuge at 11,000 rcf for 15’.
14.	Transfer the upper (aqueous) phase (~200 µl) to a fresh 1.5 ml epp. 
15.	Add 500 µl of isopropanol.
16.	Shake/invert until it clears.
17.	Incubate for 10’ at RT with occasional mixing.
18.	Centrifuge at max. speed for 15’.
19.	Discard supernatant (Be careful for losing the pellet with pouring).
20.	Add 1 ml of 70% EtOH. Mix/invert to wash the pellet. Store O/N at -20°C.
21.	Centrifuge at max. speed for 10’.
22.	Discard supernatant (Be careful for losing the pellet with pouring. Pipet out rest).
23.	Dry the pellet for 2-5’ at RT in the fume hood.
24.	Resuspend the pellet in 32 µl of mQ (wait 60’ before subsequent use).
  a.	Optional: RNA can be resuspended for 2-3’ at 60°C.

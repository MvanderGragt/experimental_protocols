# Primer design for Stemloop PCR:
Two primers need to be designed for each unique miRNA. For the first phase, the Stemloop RT, a Stemloop RT primer 
needs to be made. This primer consists of the universal stemloop RT primer to which the 5’ 6 nt of the reverse complement DNA
sequence are added at the 3’.
For the end point PCR a universal reverse primer (GTGCAGGGTCCGAGGT, Tm 55.9&deg;C (OligoCalc)) is used. 
The forward primer needs to be miRNA specific. This consists of the miRNA sequence converted to DNA, 
of which 6 nt at the 3’-end are removed. At the 5’-end nts are added to increase the Tm equal to the Tm of the reverse primer.

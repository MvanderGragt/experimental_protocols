# RNA isolation with Trizol [in the fume hood]

## Purpose 
With this protocol total RNA of trichomes is isolated.

## Introduction

Trizol is a ready-to-use reagent for the isolation of total RNA from cells and tissues. The reagent, a mono-phasic solution of phenol and guanidine isothiocyanate, is an improvement to the single-step RNA isolation method developed by Chomczynski and Sacchi 
During sample homogenization or lysis, Trizol maintains the integrity of the RNA, while disrupting cells and dissolving cell components. Addition of chloroform followed by centrifugation, separates the solution into an aqueous phase and an organic phase. RNA remains exclusively in the aqueous phase. After transfer of the aqueous phase, the RNA is recovered by precipitation with isopropyl alcohol. After removal of the aqueous phase, the DNA and proteins in the sample can be recovered by sequential precipitation. Precipitation with ethanol yields DNA from the interphase, and an additional precipitation with isopropyl alcohol yields proteins from the organic phase.

Trizolis toxic in contact with skin and if swallowed. Trizol causes burns. After contact with  skin, wash immediately with plenty of detergent and water.

## Materials
- Dry ice
- Liquid nitrogen
- Chloroform (fresh)
- Isopropanol (=2-propanol)
- 70 % Ethanol (in RNase free water)
- RNase-free H2O: autoclave 20’ 120˚C.	
- RNase-free tips, eppendorf-tubes (2 ml and 1.5 ml/ use safelock tubes for Trizol!)
- Trizol

## Methods

- Grind the plant tissue under liquid nitrogen to a fine powder.
- Homogenize tissue samples in 1ml Trizol (per 50-100 mg of tissue).
- Mix the sample by vortexing vigorously  (~ 10") until the tissue is dissolved.
- Incubate the homogenized samples for 5' at RT.
- Add 200 µl chloroform.
- Shake by hand for 15".
- Incubate at RT for 2 – 3'. Invert tubes regularly.
- Centrifuge the samples for 15' at 11 000 rpm at 4°C.
- Transfer 500 µl upper aqueous phase to a fresh Rnase- free tube.
- Add 500 µl isopropanol - invert tube 6-8 times by hand.
- Precipitate RNA over nighth in -20°C freezer.
- Centrifuge for 10' at 11 000 rpm. 
- Remove the supernatant.
- Wash the RNA pellet 2 times with 1 ml of 70 % ethanol.
- Centrifuge the sample for 5' at 11 000 rpm. 
- Dry the pellet for 10' at RT (air-dry).
- Dissolve pellet in 30-40 µl MQ or RNase-free water.
